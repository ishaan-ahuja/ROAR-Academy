# Please write two functions swap_rows(M, a, b) and swap_cols(M, a, b),
# where M is a NumPy matrix. swap_rows() swaps the a-th row and b-th row of
# M, and swap_cols() swaps the a-th column and the b-th column of M.
# Note: Please in your code include sufficient argument sanity check to make
# sure to be able to handle potential corner cases.
