# In the Lecture, we discussed rendering a clock interface that display the real-
# time system clock in the sample code: matplotlib_clock.py. In this exercise,
# we will attempt to improve the graphics of the system clock.
# Please solve:
# 1. 2. 3. Remove the Axes (‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’, ‘right’) displayed together with the
# clock.
# In the sample code, the hour and minute hands only point to full hour and
# minute numbers, respectively. In other words, their positions are not
# updated following the second hand movement, which is not realistic.
# Improve the code to have the hour and minute hands to update their
# positions synchronized with the movement of the second hand.
# Add a fourth clock hand, called the GMT hand. The GMT hand should be
# rendered in yellow color, and it will point to the hour of the GMT time zone
# but utilize the clock face to indicate the 24 hours instead of 12 hours as in
# displaying the local time. Namely, 0 o’clock GMT hour hand will point to
# the 0 degree , and 12 o’clock GMT hour hand will point to the 180 degree.
